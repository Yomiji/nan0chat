# Nan0
### Protobuf Nanoservice Framework for Go
##### Purpose
This framework is designed to make it easier to pass messages between nanoservices, which are just a fancy name for
lightweight microservices that compose some of my work.

##### Usage
When I put together the framework, I needed a way to build the services without having to worry about the network
transport protocols, message handshaking and so forth. Here are the primary uses and caveats:

* There is a logging pattern in place for this plugin, to configure it, follow the steps in **Logging** section of this
  readme or simply call the NoLogging function to disable logging from this framework:
  ```go
    package main
    import "nan0"
    
    func init() {
        nan0.NoLogging()
    }
  ```
* The **Service** type defines the actual nanoservices that you can create to serve as a client OR server. In order to
  quickly establish a Service, just instantiate a Service object and call the member function Start on it. You will
  still need to take the listener returned from this function and create a server:
  ```go
    package main
    
    import (
        "nan0"
        "time"
        "io"
        "fmt"
    )
    
    //NOTE: Error checking omitted for demonstration purposes only, PLEASE be more vigilant in production systems.
    func main() {
        // Create a nan0 service
        service := &nan0.Service{
            ServiceName: "TestService",
            Port:        4546,
            HostName:    "127.0.0.1",
            ServiceType: "Test",
            StartTime:   time.Now().Unix(),
        }
        
        // Start a server
        listener, _ := service.Start()
        
        // Shutdown when finished
        defer listener.Close()
        
        // Create an echo service, every protocol buffer sent to this service will be echoed back
        go func() {
            conn, _ := listener.Accept()
            for ; ; {
                io.Copy(conn, conn)
            }
        }()
        
        // Establish a client connection
        comm,_ := service.DialNan0(false, service, 0, 0)
        
        // Shutdown when finished
        defer comm.Close()
        
        // The nan0.Nan0 allows for sending and receiving protobufs on channels for communication
        sender := comm.GetSender()
        receiver := comm.GetReceiver()
        
        // Send a protocol buffer, yes nan0.Service is a protobuf type
        sender <- service
        // Wait to receive a response, which should be the Service back again in this case due to the echo code above
        result := <-receiver
        
        // Test the results, should be the same
        if service.String() == result.String() {
            fmt.Println("Service was echoed back")
        }
    }
  ```
* You can create a secure service with authentication and encryption by creating ***Secret*** and ***Auth*** keys and
  calling the **DialNan0Secure** method. There are also DecryptProtobuf and EncryptProtobuf for use in server code.
  ```go
    package main
    
    import (
        "nan0"
        "time"
    )
    
    // establish secrets and pass them to your server and client
    var secretKey = nan0.NewEncryptionKey()
    var authKey = nan0.NewHMACKey()
    
    func main() {
    	
    	// create a new service to connect to
        ns := &nan0.Service{
            ServiceName: "TestService",
            Port:        3234,
            HostName:    "127.0.0.1",
            ServiceType: "Test",
            StartTime:   time.Now().Unix(),
        }
        
        // use the resulting nanoservice connection
        ns.DialNan0Secure(secretKey, authKey).
            ToggleWriteDeadline(true).
            MessageIdentity(ns).
            SendBuffer(0).
            ReceiveBuffer(0).
        BuildNan0()
    }
  ```

* The **DiscoveryService** type defines a server that registers several nanoservices under a specified type and by name.
  Connect to the DiscoveryService using a Dial to obtain the list of Services registered.
  ```go
    package main
    
    import (
        "nan0"
        "time"
        "net"
        "io/ioutil"
        "github.com/golang/protobuf/proto"
    )
    
    func main() {
        // Create a DiscoveryService object
        discoveryService := nan0.NewDiscoveryService(4677, 10)
        
        // Remember to shutdown
        defer discoveryService.Shutdown()
    
        // Create a nanoservice
        ns := &nan0.Service{
            ServiceType:"Test",
            StartTime:time.Now().Unix(),
            ServiceName:"TestService",
            HostName:"::1",
            Port:5555,
            Expired: false,
        }
    
        // Register the service with the discovery service
        ns.Register("::1", 4677)
        
        // Connect to discoveryService and read to fill ServiceList structure to get all services
        conn, _ := net.Dial("tcp", "[::1]:4677")
        b,_ := ioutil.ReadAll(conn)
        services := &nan0.ServiceList{}
        proto.Unmarshal(b, services)
        
        // Do something with available services
        _ = services.ServicesAvailable
    }
    ```
* The DiscoveryService returns a **ServiceList** object

##### Logging
This framework has a logging package that is used to inform the consumer of the details of operation. The logging
mechanism is remotely similar to some packages in other languages such as Java's slf4j; or at least I'd like it to be
similar to something most people have seen before. That being said there are some functions that must be discussed, as
the default settings may be more verbose than you need.

* There are four logging levels: ***Debug***, ***Info***, ***Warn***, and ***Error***
* All of the logging levels are enabled by default, to disable them, you must set the corresponding logger to ***nil***.
    ```go
      package main
      
      import "nan0"
      
      func main() {
      	nan0.Debug = nil
      }
    ```
* You can reassign the logger from console to another writer using the **SetLogWriter** function.
    ```go
      package main
      
      import (
      	"nan0"
      	"net"
      )
      
      func main() {
      	logserv,_ := net.Dial("tcp", "localhost:1234")
      	nan0.SetLogWriter(logserv)
      }
    ```

##### Security Features
Security in Nan0 takes place at the connection level. The underlying network packets have the following structure
(constructed in the step order):

1. Message header preamble (by default 7 bytes)
2. HMAC size header (8 bytes max)
3. Size header (8 bytes max)
4. Encrypted bytes (length of "Size header" bytes)

Inside the encrypted bytes, a marshalled protobuf is signed using the HMAC key to provide a layer of authentication.

To utilize the encryption features, you must first create a private encryption key and an hmac authentication key, these
keys need to be used with the server and client.

```go
package main

import (
	"nan0"
	"encoding/base64"
)

// A simple function to make the keys generated a sharable string
func shareKeys() (encKeyShare, authKeyShare string) {
	encKeyBytes := nan0.NewEncryptionKey()
	authKeyBytes := nan0.NewHMACKey()
	
	encKeyShare = base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(encKeyBytes[:])
	authKeyShare = base64.StdEncoding.EncodeToString(authKeyBytes[:])
	
	return
}

// The nan0 functions require a specific key type and width, this is a way to make 
// that conversion from strings to the required type.
//NOTE: Error checking omitted for demonstration purposes only, PLEASE be more vigilant in production systems.
func keysToNan0Bytes(encKeyShare, authKeyShare string) (encKey, authKey *[32]byte) {
	encKeyBytes,_ := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(encKeyShare)
	authkeyBytes,_ := base64.StdEncoding.DecodeString(authKeyShare)
	
	copy(encKey[:], encKeyBytes)
	copy(authKey[:], authkeyBytes)
	
	return
} 
```

The server will use the EncryptProtobuf and DecryptProtobuf functions to construct messages passed to the client. The
encryption is mostly abstracted from clients, messages can be retrieved or sent on the streams without regard to the
encryption protocol, however, you must use DialNan0Secure method on their client instead of DialNan0.
```go
package main

import (
	"nan0"
	"time"
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	// Create a nan0 service
	service := &nan0.Service{
		ServiceName: "TestService",
		Port:        4546,
		HostName:    "127.0.0.1",
		ServiceType: "Test",
		StartTime:   time.Now().Unix(),
	}

	// Start a server
	listener, _ := service.Start()

	// Shutdown when finished
	defer listener.Close()

	// Trivially create encryption and signing keys
	encKey := nan0.NewEncryptionKey()
	authKey := nan0.NewHMACKey()
	
	// Create an echo service, every protocol buffer sent to this service will be echoed back
	go func() {
		conn, _ := listener.Accept()
		for ; ; {
			// whenever we receive something, send the service, encrypted
			conn.Write(nan0.EncryptProtobuf(service, encKey, authKey))
		}
	}()

	// Establish a secure client connection
	comm,_ := service.DialNan0Secure(encKey, authKey).
		ToggleWriteDeadline(true).
		MessageIdentity(service).
		SendBuffer(0).
		ReceiveBuffer(0).
	BuildNan0()

	// Shutdown when finished
	defer comm.Close()

	// The nan0.Nan0 allows for sending and receiving protobufs on channels for communication
	sender := comm.GetSender()
	receiver := comm.GetReceiver()

	// Send a protocol buffer, yes nan0.Service is a protobuf type
	sender <- service
	
	// Wait to receive a response, which should be the service as sent above (we ignored the sender silently)
	result := <-receiver

	// Test the results, should be the same
	if service.String() == result.String() {
		fmt.Println("Service was echoed back")
	}
}
```

The security framework is based off of [cryptopasta](https://github.com/gtank/cryptopasta) so you should check this
project out for more information on the actual implementation of security methods.


##### Planned Features
* Create a separate configuration for writer timeouts
* Document nan0 settings
* Add godoc examples
